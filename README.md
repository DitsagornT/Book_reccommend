# Application of Deep Learning for Book Recommendation System

This project is a Deep Learning-based Book Recommendation System developed as part of my Master’s degree in Software Engineering for Data Science Program. 
It utilizes **Autoencoder** models to recommend books based on user rating patterns, and is deployed with **Streamlit** for an interactive web-based user experience.

**Live Demo**: [Try it on Streamlit](https://bookreccommend-714.streamlit.app/)
